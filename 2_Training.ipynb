    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "The archtecture of our model basically follows the paper [arXiv:1411.4555](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf). \n",
    "The detail is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the encoder part, we used the pretrained ResNet50 model that can be imported by `torchvision.models.resnet50`. \n",
    "This part reads a color `224x224` image and outputs features of size `256`. Then these image features are processed by the embedding layer with size `embed_size = 512`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- For the decoder part, the embedded image features (i.e. the output of the encoder) and the last batch of the \n",
    "captions processed by the embedding layer with size `embed_size = 512` are concatenated first. Then this \n",
    "concatenated tensor is input to the LSTM cell. For the LSTM cell, we used 1 layer only and the number of\n",
    "the features of the hidden state is taken to `hidden_size=512`.\n",
    "The output of the LSTM cell is processed by a single fully connected layer with the number of units equal to the vocabulary size. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some comments are in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the `batch_size`, we first tried 32 and 64, but, during the training process, we could see the cross entropy loss fluctuates a lot. We thus finally chose `batch_size = 128` with which we could reduce the fluctuation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For the `vocabulary_threshold`, we started with several large values (such as 10) so that vocabulary size does not become large and training does not a lot of time. Since the large `vocabulary_threshold` does not gives a good \n",
    "performance, we decreased the value and ended up with `vocabulary_threshold=3`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For `embed_size` and `hidden_size`, we followed [arXiv:1411.4555](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) and \n",
    "set them to `512`. We also tried some larger values but the performance did not improve very much. \n",
    "(If smaller values are used on the other hand, the model does not learn well and returned the same caption for \n",
    "many different images.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the number of epochs `num_epochs`, we set to `3` as instructed in this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "We left `transform_train` as it is given. Since COCO dataset contains images with various sizes, \n",
    "important to resize so that the image size matches with the input size `224x224` of the ResNet50 we used in \n",
    "the encoder part. For this purpse, resizing to a little bit larger size `256x256` first and then cropping \n",
    "`224x224` part is reasonable. This cropping also effectively plays the role of rescaling and translation of the original images. \n",
    "Thus this cropping combined with the random flip in the horizontal direction is expected to reduce potential \n",
    "bias that the original images can have, helping our model to learn more efficiently. After these preprocessings, \n",
    "the image data is converted to a tensor so that we can input to our encoder model. \n",
    "In the end, it is important to normalize each entry in the data corresponding to the image \n",
    "before inputting to the encoder model. This also helps the training of the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "For the encoder part, since we imported the pretrained ResNet50 model, for the parameters in this part,\n",
    "we did not train and used the imported value (taking into our numerical resource, it is reasonable). \n",
    "The only trainable parameters in the encoder part is thus those in the embedding layer. For the decoder part, \n",
    "we trained the parameters in all the layers, i.e. the embedding layer (for the captions), \n",
    "LSTM layer and the fully connected layer in the end.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "For the optimizer, we chose the Adam optimizer. We tried the simple Steepest Gradient Descent as well as RMSprop\n",
    "but the cross entropy loss decreased faster when the Adam optimizer is used. For the choice of the learning rate\n",
    "we started with a large value (such as 0.01), but the fluctuation of the loss was large and the loss did not decrease\n",
    "well in the later part of the training process. We thus tried some smaller values and chose 0.001 as the learning \n",
    "rate in the end. \n",

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "## Step 3: (Optional) Validate your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
